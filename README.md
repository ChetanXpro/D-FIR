# D-FIR System

## What is D-FIR

## Why D-FIR

Most people dread going to the police station when a crime takes place. There is usually a feeling that registering a complaint is a tedious process or that the police will not be cooperative. But that shouldn’t stop anybody from taking action against a crime.

## Process of De-FIR Registration

1. **Verification of Complainant:** We use [Anon Aadhar](https://anon-aadhaar-documentation.vercel.app/) for this process.
2. **Securing Suspect’s Name:** To be discussed
3. **Time Limit for Signing:** To be discussed
4. **Police Verification:** To be discussed
5. **Complainant’s Signature:** To be discussed (this is the main pain point even in e-FIR)
6. **Limitations:** This process applies only when the accused is known. (Didn’t understand it)

It is essential to recognize that e-FIRs do not represent an entirely automated process; they rely on the physical signatures of complainants within a specified time frame. This limitation means that investigations initiated before the formal registration of the FIR may not align with the standard procedures of the Code of Criminal Procedure.

## \***\*Limited Efficacy of De-FIRs\*\***

It is essential to recognize that e-FIRs do not represent an entirely automated process; they rely on the physical signatures of complainants within a specified time frame. This limitation means that investigations initiated before the formal registration of the FIR may not align with the standard procedures of the Code of Criminal Procedure.

## **Potential Misconceptions**

Allowing a three-day window for D-FIR registration might give the impression to the common man that it will not affect the case negatively during that period. However, this might not align with the nuances of certain crimes, and complainants may not fully grasp the urgency or importance of their cases.
