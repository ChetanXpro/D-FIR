# D-FIR (Decentralized - First Information Report) System

[Building Trust with Transparency: Experience Immutable and Decentralized FIR Filing on the Blockchain]

D-FIR is a decentralized FIR system built on top of Ethereum Blockchain. It is a system that allows citizens to register FIRs without having to go to the police station.

## Why D-FIR

Most people dread going to the police station when a crime takes place. There is usually a feeling that registering a complaint is a tedious process or that the police will not be cooperative. But that shouldnâ€™t stop anybody from taking action against a crime.

## Process of De-FIR Registration

1. **Verification of Complainant Citizenship:** We use [Anon Aadhar](https://anon-aadhaar-documentation.vercel.app/) for this process.
2. **Citizen Fills the Form:** The citizen fills the form with the details of the crime.

## Instructions to run it.

- On the root directory inside a terminal type and run `yarn start` to start frontend.
- Then again on another terminal in the root directory type and run `yarn chain`.
